# Coding Challenges ðŸ§©
<i>"Where algorithms meet storytelling â€” solve problems that feel like mini adventures."</i>

<div>
  A curated collection of story-driven programming challenges solved in Java and Python.
Each challenge lives in its own folder and contains:

ðŸ“œ Problem Statement â€” a short, themed scenario to make the challenge fun and engaging.

ðŸ’» Solution â€” implemented in either Java or Python, sometimes both.

These are not just algorithm problems â€” theyâ€™re mini-adventures where logic and code meet storytelling.
Youâ€™ll find challenges involving backtracking puzzles, grid traversals, pathfinding mysteries, and more.
