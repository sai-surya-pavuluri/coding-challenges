Story: "The King's Vault"
A wise king has a vault filled with precious artifacts, arranged in a specific order of value. The vault is guarded by a complex security system that only allows access if an individual can find a specific artifact based on its value. The artifacts are arranged in a way that they follow a particular structure.

The king needs you to write a program to help him quickly retrieve any artifact by its value.

Your task:
Create a Binary Search Tree (BST) where each node represents an artifact with a specific value.
Implement a method to insert a new artifact into the tree, maintaining the BST property.
Write a method to search for an artifact based on its value, and return whether it was found in the vault or not
