Deep in the archives of the Cipher Institute, there’s an ancient tablet inscribed with a letter grid.
Rumor has it that secret phrases are hidden inside this grid, but there’s a catch:

The phrases can twist and turn in any direction (up, down, left, right).

A special symbol ? acts as a wildcard — a chameleon rune that can become any letter.

Each tile can be stepped on only once during a single search.

Your mission is to write a program that determines if a given phrase (possibly with wildcards) can be traced within the maze.
Find the phrase, and you unlock the next layer of the Cipher’s secrets. Fail… and the grid remains silent forever.

# Example

Tablet (grid):
A B C E
S F C S
A D E E

Queries:
"ABCCED"   → True  (Path found)
"A?CCED"   → True  ('?' matches 'B')
"SEE"      → True
"ABCB"     → False
"?FCE"     → True
