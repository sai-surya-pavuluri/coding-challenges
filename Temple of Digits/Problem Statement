📖 The Story:

In the ancient Temple of Digits, there’s a mystical lock that guards the Scroll of Infinity.
The lock isn’t like ordinary locks — it doesn’t accept a single code. Instead, it will only open if you chant aloud all possible secret numbers that obey its rules.

Here’s how the lock works:

The lock demands a number of exactly n digits.

Each pair of consecutive digits in that number must have a difference of exactly k.

The first digit can never be 0 (the lock despises leading zeroes).

If you whisper even one number that breaks these rules, the temple slams shut forever. But if you enumerate all the correct numbers, the lock opens, and the scroll is yours.

🧩 The Challenge (Problem Statement)

You are given two integers n and k.
Return all valid numbers of length n such that:

No number has leading zeroes.

The absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is exactly k.

Return the list in any order.

🔑 Examples

Example 1

Input: n = 3, k = 7

Output: [181, 292, 707, 818, 929]

Explanation: 070 is invalid (leading zero).

Example 2

Input: n = 2, k = 1

Output: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]

🏹 Constraints

2 <= n <= 9
0 <= k <= 9
