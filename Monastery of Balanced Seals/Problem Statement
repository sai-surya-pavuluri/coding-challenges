The Monastery of Balanced Seals 🏯
Premise

You’re an apprentice Sealsmith in the Monastery of Balanced Seals.
Each seal is forged by pressing open ( and close ) runes onto a strip of parchment.

A seal is valid only if:

No close rune ever appears without a matching open rune before it.

By the end, every open rune has been properly closed.

Your master hands you n pairs of runes and says:

“Forge every distinct valid seal you can. Only balanced seals protect the realm.”

Your Mission

Input: An integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 8) — the number of rune pairs.
Output: All distinct balanced seals (strings of length 2n) made from ( and ).

Example

n = 3 → ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]

n = 1 → ["()"]
